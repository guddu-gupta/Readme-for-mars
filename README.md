# Rope Climbing Robot

##Applications

Robot is planned to serve the following tasks:

- It can be used to carry weights or to drop weights from some height.

- When equipped with camera, the robot can be used for surveillence

- When equipped with cleaners, it can be used to clean glasses of windows or walls (when rope is attached between top floor and ground floor.)

- Robot can be used to take pictures or to make videos from different heights.

### Brief Explanation of the above applications

Robot is primarily designed for surveillence purposes. This robot can even be used at harsh environmental conditions which makes it useful to military for surveillence.
 The surveillance robots have image acquisition provision to hunt for the targeted object. Hence an essential component that is a wireless camera should be
equipped to track the targeted object under surveillance. Robot can also be used to clean walls and glasses which are unreachable for humans. Dropping weights
and carrying weights to a specific heights are some obvious tasks which this robot can perform. Construction industry can use the robot for taking or dropping 
weights. Cinematographers can also use the robot as it offers the ability to take pictures or make videos for various heights.
